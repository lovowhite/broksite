                    <p class="text-left" style="font-size:20px;">I was born in Long Beach, California and have resided in the South Bay formost of my life. As a youth, I lived in Palos Verdes Estates on RositaPlace and on Shady Vista in Rolling Hills Estates. My family has beeninvolved in real estate
                        for 4 generations, in fact my grandmother's maidenname was "Frame" and her father was a big part of the development of theSouth Bay. </p>
                    <p class="text-left" style="font-size:20px;"> Due to my involvement in professional sports, I specialize with athletesand luxury home owners looking to purchase/re-locate and understand theimportance of privacy and the process of relocating. &nbsp;I played baseball forthe Los
                        Angeles Angels of Anaheim and have had the privilege to play ballall around the country for many of the Angels farm teams. &nbsp;After havingwitnessed the drastic climate changes and plain topography in variousstates throughout
                        the country, I now understand why so many families decideto call California "home". </p>
                    <p class="text-left" style="font-size:20px;"> As a 4th generation Real Estate professional in the South Bay, myroots in California grow deep and is where I have resided the majority ofmy life. &nbsp;With a lengthy family history in Southern Californiabuying/selling, developing
                        and building homes, I have the team andresources to tackle some of the most difficult real estate situations.Studied business/Economics at the University of Santa Barbara and value theimportance of pricing a home correctly and
                        establishing a comparativemarket analysis through price per sq/ft and location. &nbsp;I understand thecommitment and emotions that occur in each real estate transaction. &nbsp;As theold saying goes "There is no place like home."
